                research in this game is verry important.
                That is to make sure that you can't start automating evrything form the sart. With that it makes it still a challenge.
                you need to think about how you are going to do something without a certain item.
                 But when you finaly get that said item you can rething what you have alreaddy build and make it way more efficient

                The gameplay in this game in not vor everyone. It's about thinking and rebuilding over and over.
                In ths game you need to have a good brain for math. You have to figure out how for example: 
                (you make 25 iron per min the press needs 50 iron per min and the crafter needs 15 iron sheets mer min)
                so that is a lot of math you have to do. Also when you think its finaly over you unlocked a new item or building that can make it way more efficient
